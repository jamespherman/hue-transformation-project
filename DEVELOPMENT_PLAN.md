This document tracks the development of the Hue-Expansion Tool. As the coding agent completes each task, the corresponding item will be moved from 'To-Do' to 'Completed' and its checkbox will be marked as done.

## To-Do

### Phase 1: Application Scaffolding and UI Layout
- [ ] Task 1.1: Initialize App Designer Project as HueExpansionApp.mlapp.
- [ ] Task 1.2: Create the main 2-column layout grid (250px fixed left, weighted right).
- [ ] Task 1.3: Add UIAxes for 'OriginalAxes' and 'ProcessedAxes' in the right column.
- [ ] Task 1.4: Add a UIPanel ('Controls') and a UIButton ('Load Image') in the left column.
- [ ] Task 1.5: Add parameter control components to the 'Controls' panel:
    - [ ] UISlider for Hue Center (HueCenterSlider).
    - [ ] UISlider for Hue Width (HueWidthSlider).
    - [ ] UISlider for Saturation Threshold (SaturationSlider).
    - [ ] UISlider for Value Threshold (ValueSlider).
    - [ ] UICheckBox for 'Shift Output Spectrum' (ShiftSpectrumCheckBox).

### Phase 2: Implementing Core Functionality
- [ ] Task 2.1: Implement the LoadImageButton callback to load an image into a private property (OriginalRGB) and display it.
- [ ] Task 2.2: Convert the starter_script.m logic into a private helper method named processImage.
- [ ] Task 2.3: Create a central private method named updateProcessedImage that calls processImage and displays the result.
- [ ] Task 2.4: Create and assign a shared callback to all sliders and the checkbox that triggers updateProcessedImage.

### Phase 3: Refinement and User Experience
- [ ] Task 3.1: Add UINumericEditField components linked to each slider for precise value input.
- [ ] Task 3.2: Implement a startupFcn to automatically load 'your_endoscopic_image.jpg' if it exists.
- [ ] Task 3.3: Add a 'Save Processed Image' button and implement its callback function.
- [ ] Task 3.4: Implement basic error handling for file I/O operations.

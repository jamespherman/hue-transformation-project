# Hue-Expansion Interactive Tool

## Synopsis

This tool is a MATLAB application for visualizing hue expansion transformations on images, designed for research and educational purposes in fields like medical imaging and visual neuroscience.

## Core Features

* Load standard image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.).
* Real-time preview of a processed image alongside the original.
* Interactive sliders and controls for adjusting hue expansion parameters (center, width, saturation/value thresholds).
* Numeric input fields for precise parameter control.
* Option to shift the output spectrum for different perceptual mappings.
* Ability to save the processed image.
* Automatically loads `your_endoscopic_image.jpg` if present in the directory on startup.

## Technology

This application is built using MATLAB, with a programmatically generated user interface.

## How to Run

To run the application, open MATLAB, navigate to the project directory, and run the `runHueExpansionApp.m` script from the command window or editor.

```matlab
runHueExpansionApp
```
